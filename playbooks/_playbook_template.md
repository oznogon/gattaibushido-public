**Note to Gray Pawn:** This document is written in Markdown, a simple text-based markup language and my preferred method of pre-production game design these days. It will look best in an actual Markdown editor. I recommend the following editors, depending on your platform:

* ALL: [Atom](https://atom.io/) (but if you're not used to it, it can be a pain to figure out)
* MAC: [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
* PC: either [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/wereturtle/ghostwriter) or [Markdown Edit](https://github.com/mike-ward/Markdown-Edit)

# (PLAYBOOK TITLE) Chroma: The Role (evocative quip)

(**Design example for Gray Pawn:**  "Pink: The Heart of the Team (right there, on her sleeve, for all to see)" )

[INSERT PORTRAIT ART]

(Insert Introductory Text, details about the Role. Maybe three or four sentences, max.)

**Palette Swap:** Love the role, but not feeling the specific hue? Here are some genre-inspired alternatives:

* **Alt1:** DESCRIPTION
* **Alt2:** DESCRIPTION


# Concept Pitch

Tell us about your Pilot. We want to know her as a real person, a living and breathing member of the team. What's her recent story? What's she all about? Just enough to give us an introduction and some ideas for now - we don't need a deep dive or a grand speech!

Below are some initial "personal" questions to answer, and suggested options. Circle one of the given options if it speaks to you, or develop your own. And when you're ready, tell everyone!

**Name Suggestions:** blah, blah, blah

**Favorite Accessory:** blah, blah, blah

**Favorite Food:** blah, blah, blah

**What is your "thing?"** blah, blah, blah

(examples:)

* Anime/Manga
* Ballet
* Bonsai
* Cooking
* Cosplay
* Kickboxing
* Finding a Boyfriend
* Military Fangirl
* Motorcycle Racing
* RPGs
* Scrapbooking
* Tennis
* Wine
* ...or something else!*

**What is your Yearbook Quote?** What quote did you have under your yearbook photo for this most recent year of Battle School? This one's all up to you!


# What Do Your Friends Think of You?

Now let's take your concept a step further, and start writing down some numbers! Use the following descriptive adjective choices to build your Pilot's initial **Commitments** spread. **First pick one** on your own and fill in its dot. **Then** have the players to your left and right each pick one as well. **Finally**, once three have been selected, total their stat mods and note them on your final record sheet under Commitments, resulting in six point mods in total.

(bubble dot list):

* Arrogant: +2 Self
* Brash: +1 Fight, +1 Self
* Heroic: +1 Team, +1 Fight
* Popular: +1 Team, +1 Self
* Selfless: +2 Team
* Violent: +2 Fight

Don't see something you like? Coach has rules for custom stats and adjectives!

(**PLAYTEST NOTE #1:** These are currently identical across playbooks for testing stage. Use them as inspiration to create your own. Final release will feature individual multi-item arrays tailored to the Chroma.)

(**PLAYTEST NOTE #2:** I'm reassessing these to bring them back in line with the reverted Commitment Dualities. The new idea is to pick three descriptors, from three different lists, but I'm working to rewrite the lists anew.)


# (Chroma Name's) Power Profile

As the (Role Name), your specialty is (Role Details Shortform). **First**, this lets you pick one of your two core powers as your Pilot's starting specialty. These can evolve over time, and you can eventually unlock all three if you want! Pick one right now, and fill in the "Level 1" dot next to it.

* **"Power Name!"** - (Passive Tech) Description
* **"Power Name!"** - (Charge Tech) Description

(Text Note for Players: You don't actually *have* to pick right now if you aren't sure. It can be even more fun to decide later on once the game begins, letting your power emerge in the story as something new and unknown! Be sure and tell Coach if you want to do this.)

**Design note for Gray Pawn:** each of the core techs might display slightly differently based on the playbook. For example, Blue's Passive Tech just gives her one basic power with three ranks, each increasing it +1 in ability. However her Active Tech actually gives her three different brand new actions to choose from! Some of them have three choices for each, some a mix like Blue, and some have two basic multi-rank powers just like Blue's Passive.

**Design note for Gray Pawn, Continued:** For example, I've included the current versions of Blue's two powers below:

* **Passive Tech: "Advance Warning!"** Blue is always prepared for the dangers ahead. One per *Scenario* per rank invested in this Tech, when Coach chooses to Spend (flip) an Active Omen to trigger an Crisis event, Blue can negate the event. The Omen is still spent, but the event does not trigger, and the Crisis Level remains at its previous position.
* (**PLAYTEST ALTERNATE:** Blue is always prepared for the dangers ahead. Once per *Session* per rank invested in this Tech, when a Joker is revealed, Blue can choose to immediately send it to the bottom of the Deck, skipping all Joker-related events and effects.)

* **Charge Tech: "Strategic Action!"** Each rank invested in this Tech gives you an exclusive new Throwdown Action of your choice from the list below, in any order you desire:

* New Action: "Strategic Pass" (Main, Blue Pilot): Spend 2 Charges to voluntarily skip your turn in the rotation. You cannot take any Side Actions this turn, and active assist chains skip over you. You cannot take this action if you are the only active Pilot in the rotation.
* New Action: "Strategic Reassessment!" (Side, Blue Pilot): Spend Charges to draw one card into your Hand, from either the top of the Deck (1 Charge) or the top of the Trash (2 Charges). Then, discard one card from your Hand.
* New Action: "Strategic Foresight!" (Side, Blue Pilot): Spend X # of Charges and look at the top X cards on any Deck, then put them back down on top in the same order, or instead spend the same amount of Charges again to reorder them. You cannot tell anyone else what they are. This is the *only* time when a Pilot is allowed to touch the cards in Coach's Deck.



## Team Mods

Your choice of Chroma also indirectly affects the Team by adjusting background stats and resources.


### Starting Team Adjustments

During Team Creation, adjust the following team resources automatically:

* **Harmony:** +X
* **Armory:** +X
* **Fan Club:** +X
* **Pit Crew:** +X


### Recurring Team Adjustments

At the start of every brand new Scenario, make the following additional Resource adjustments:

* **Harmony:** +X
* **Armory:** +X
* **Fan Club:** +X
* **Pit Crew:** +X


## Chroma Lesson Trigger

**Next**, note your Chroma's special Lesson trigger. This is a special prompt that allows you to gain Lessons during play by role-playing your role's strengths and weaknesses in purely narrative ways.

* **Lesson Trigger:** DESCRIPTION


## Chroma Gambit Specialty

When you incorporate your Chroma's specialty directly into a Gambit, you add more narrative effect to the outcome!

* **Gambit Specialties:** DESCRIPTION.


# What Weapon Do You Wield?

Now it's time to choose the weapon that you specialize in when fighting The Enemy face to face. First pick the frame that speaks to your style, or instead choose based on the power you like the most!

* base choice 1: TECH DESCRIPTION (does not require a charge)
* base choice 2: TECH DESCRIPTION (does not require a charge)
* base choice 3: TECH DESCRIPTION (does not require a charge)

#### Now Give It Some Power!

Once you've chosen your base weapon, pick from one of the following extra powers and add it to the weapon!

* quality choice 1: TECH DESCRIPTION (requires a charge)
* quality choice 2: TECH DESCRIPTION (requires a charge)
* quality choice 3: TECH DESCRIPTION (requires a charge)


# What Robo Do You Pilot?

This is what being a Pilot is all about! Pick your robo:


#### (Adjective), But/And (Other Adjective): The (1st Robot Name)

(Short Description, maybe two or three sentences max)

Note the following core components:

* **Robo Rank:** This starts at 1
* **Summon Effect:** (triggers when you first summon the Robo in a session) DESCRIPTION
* **Rider Bonus:** (special bonus while in the cockpit) DESCRIPTION

(**PLAYTEST NOTE:** Currently each playbook will likely be listed with a single robo, to save on cross-document multi-edits. In the final release, each playbook will be given multiple options - probably two or three. For now, if you want to use a different robo, use the data from the other playbooks.)


# Concept Expansion

Now that you have figured out all the math stuff, let's get back to finishing up your Concept with some *much* deeper questions!


#### Team Sacrifices


**Tell us one time you pissed off or even outright humiliated the Pilot to your left.** What did you do? Why was she forced to let it go? That Pilot's player must record this as her first Sacrifice.

* **YOURS:** (Given to you by the player to *your* right)


**Tell us about a really gnarly fight that the Pilot to your right got into, in defense of the Team or someone on it.** Who were they fighting, and why? Who started it? Who won? That Pilot's player must record this as her second Sacrifice.

* **YOURS:** (Given to you by the player to *your* left)


**Finally, tell us about a relationship that you lost due to your joining this Team.** Who or what was lost to you? How did this loss happen? How do you feel about it? Record this below as your own third Sacrifice:

* **YOURS:** (write it here)


#### Final Story Questions

**What is the worst thing you've ever done in pursuit of a personal victory?**

# For Later: Evolution!

As you learn Lessons through play, you will acquire Evolutions which you can spend to increase your Pilot's current powers, or even add new ones. The rules are explained more in the game book, but for now, follow this basic flow when you start getting them:

1. **Your First Evolution:** Evolve one of your Tech Paths
2. **Your Second Evolution:** Evolve a different Tech Path
3. **Your Third Evolution:** Evolve your Commitments

**Evolve Tech Paths:** When you evolve this, pick one of the following:

* **Chroma:** Either add a Level to one of your Role Techs, or acquire a new Role Tech from your list.
* **Power Weapon:** Add a new Quality Tech of your choice to the weapon.
* **Personal Robo:** Increase your Robo Rank by 1.

**Evolve Commitments:** When you evolve this, give yourself a new descriptive adjective, and an associated +1 increase to any single Commitment of your choice.


# Derive Additional Stats

Note the following final array of derived stats for your Pilot:

* **Buffer:** Base equals your Synapse stat.
* **Max Hand:** Determined by your Team's current Harmony.
* **Charge Pool:** Your Maximum Charge Pool is set by your Circuit stat It begins play at half that (round up).
* **Robo Endurance:** By default this starts at 6 plus your Robo Rank - so for now, it's 7.


# Playbook Wrap-Up

If you haven't already, now go back through the sheet and take note of all of your choices, copying them to the attached Pilot Record Sheet. From now on that will be your main game details reference, but keep this playbook worksheet around to in can you need to go back and revive your inspiration!

**Finally:** Not enough options for you? Want to tweak the choices, or roll with something else? Got your eye on a different Robo entirely? Coach has all the details and is here to help you, just ask him!

# FINAL: The Pilot Record Sheet

(TBD: A record of all the character numbers generated through the playbook process; etc; PENDING PLAYTEST PROGRESS)


# QUICK REFERENCE RULES

**Note to Gray Pawn:** I want a small section of quick-ref rules if possible. Thoughts so far:


## Basic Charge Techs:

* **Restore Buffer (Side Action):** 3 Charges per 1 Buffer
* **Boost Strike (Side Action):** 3 Charge per +1 to Strike
