## Black: The Wild Card (beloved reaper, abundant void)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Black (The Wild Card): -1 Harmony, +1 Armory, +2 Fan Club, +1 Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Black (The Wild Card): -1 Harmony, +2 Fan Club

**Lesson Trigger:** Black earns a Lesson when circumstances force her to follow the predictable path.

**Gambit Specialties:** *All* of Black's Gambits are played Blind from the Deck, and count as her Specialty. If the resulting card is Black, ignore its value and use 12 instead (or 11 in Ichi Mode). If the resulting card is Red, ignore its value and "fail" the Gambit.


### Primary Tech

**New Special Action: "Wild Power!"** (Passive, Black Pilot)

If there's one thing you can always expect from Black, it's that she never does what's expected. When Black plays down a card to Counter or Escalate, she can choose to spend up to her Wild Power rank in Charges, and then Flip the same number of cards from her Deck. She can choose to play any one of those cards instead of her already-played card. If Black plays one of the Flipped cards instead, she can then choose to double the Charge cost and return her initially-played card to her Hand. After a card is selected for Play, Discard the rest.


### Secondary Tech

**New Special Action: "Wild Surge!"** (Passive, Black Pilot)

Black gains power from the whims of chaos, drawing greater boons from both good fortune *and* the looming threats of disaster. When a Player Joker is revealed, Black gains up to her this Tech's rank in temporary bonus Buffers, in addition to the normal Joker effects. When a Coach Joker is revealed, she gains up to this Tech's rank in temporary bonus Charges. In either case, these temporary pools cannot exceed this Tech's rank. When she would spend Buffers or Charges during play, she must spend them from these pools first.


### PLAYBOOK SPECIAL



## Blue: The Brains (strategist, mastermind, all-around smart lady)

(While Red leads from the front, Blue leads from the middle.)

(Flavor description pending final release)

**Advice:** TBD

**Starting Mods:**
* Blue (The Brains): +1 each to Armory, Fanclub, and Pit Crew

**Recurring Mods:**
* Blue (The Brains): +1 to a Resource of your choosing

**Lesson Trigger:** Blue earns a Lesson when she causes disaster through over-thinking and obsessive planning.

* "**Strategic Foresight!**" (Assist): Spend up to X Charges and look at same number of cards from the top of any Deck. Then return them to the top of that Deck in any order. You cannot tell anyone else what they are. This is the *only* time when a Pilot is allowed to touch the cards in Coach's Deck.
* **Strategic Override!** (Assist): Spend up to X Charges, and up to an equal number Pilots in the Throwdown must discard a combined total of that many cards. Blue's target opponent must discard an equal number of cards. This cannot force them to discard their last card.
* "**Strategic Reassessment!**" (Assist): Spend Charges to draw up to X cards from either the top of the Deck (for 1 Charge) or the top of the Trash (for 2 Charges). Then, Discard an equal number of cards.
* **Strategic Reconfiguration!** (Assist): Spend up to X Charges and take up to X cards from up to X Pilots involved in the fight. You can then choose to distribute up to X cards to up to X Pilots involved in the fight. These do not need to be the same cards or Pilots.
* **Strategic Retreat!** (Assist): Trigger +Schism, then Spend up to X Charges and completely withdraw from the Throwdown. Give the same number of cards from your hand to up to as many other Pilots that remain. You are not allowed to participate further, nor be targeted by the Outcome, but you must participate in the Drop and Draw stage.


### Secondary Tech

**Advance Warning!:** Blue is always prepared for the dangers ahead. Once per Mission Scenario per rank invested in this Tech, when one of Coach's Jokers is revealed, Blue can choose to immediately send it to the bottom of the Deck, skipping all Joker-related events and effects.

### Secondary Tech

**Private Arsenal!** Orange is constantly acquiring cool new gadgets and weapons for her private collection, and knows who to talk to to acquire 'special" goods.

Additionally, she enjoys a discount to all Gear acquisitions equal to her Tech tier, to a minimum of 1 cost.

Purple is not bound by anyone's rules and expectations. She does what she wants, in glorious, dangerous, and surprising ways. She acquires a new special action:

**Middle Finger Scream!** (Assist): This must be played immediately before you Counter in a Throwdown. Spend up to your Tech Rank in Charges, and decrease your Strike Range by twice that amount for your next Push. This can result in a negative Strike Range, which is exactly what you want. If using this power gives you negative Strike, you can Counter with a *lower* card than the top of the Pile, as long as the difference is within the new negative Strike. Your new, lower card is now on top.

* At Tier 2, when you counter within negative Strike, you can choose to trigger +Schism anyway. If you do so, increase the multiplier of your Secondary tech by +1.
* At Tier 3, when you use this power and strike "Negative Resonant," any excess Buffers and Charges generated by your Secondary Tech are distributed to your teammates as you see fit.


### Secondary Tech
