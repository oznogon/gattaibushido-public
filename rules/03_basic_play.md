# Basics of the Decks

(all the details on the basics of how the cards work)

The Decks are the dual tools for all forms of mechanics resolution in ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** In this Chapter, we break down the basics of how the cards are used during play.


## Card Placements

During the course of play, the cards will cycle between the following places in the game space:

(TBD: include diagram!)

* the two **Decks** (from which you draw, face-down); standard playing card decks of 54 cards each, one for the Pilots and one for Coach.
* the **Pile** (where they are played, face-up); Piles are sent to the Trash after each conflict concludes.
* the **Trash** (where they are discarded, face-up); a Trash is next to each respective Deck.
* your **Hand** (which you hold during play, facing you); this is your personal ongoing and ever-changing hand of immediately-accessible playing cards.
* one or more **Factions** (as Favor, stacked face-down with topmost card face-up)
* certainly not your **Sleeve**, because that's cheating...
* and occasionally the **Floor**, where we all inevitably drop them from time to time!


### Hand

Your **Hand** is a collection of cards that you keep to yourself, hidden from the rest of the players. The majority of your Plays will come from this Hand. The Hand is a semi-transient resource which frequently fluctuates throughout a session as you play conflicts and gain power from cards and events.

All players have a Hand size determined as follows:

* **Pilots:** Your max Hand is determined by your Team's position on the Harmony scale, and only a handful of game effects will alter that.
* **Coach:** Your max Hand is set at the number of Pilots participating in the session.

During active conflicts, your current Hand size may fluctuate wildly as cards are drawn, played, and discarded. Between conflicts, if you ever hold either *fewer* or *more* than your max Hand, you must either draw back up or discard back down to max, respectively.


### Decks

There are two base **Decks** of 54 standard playing cards. *All* of the Pilots use one Deck for their actions, while Coach uses a separate Deck of his own. The Decks are placed face-down in the middle for everyone to see and reach. The Jokers in each Deck are always shuffled in face-*up*, however.

This text uses the term **The Deck** to refer to the relevant Deck of cards as determined by context. If the Pilots are told to draw from The Deck, this refers to the Pilot Deck, and likewise with Coach and his own Deck.


### Faction

**Factions** are sources of external power that the Pilots uncover through exploration and role-playing. When a Faction's favor has been acquired by the Pilots, they can invest cards from their Hand into that faction, keeping them on the table for later use. This also means that all cards on a Faction must be from the Pilot Deck. This allows well-connected Teams access to more card options beyond their rather limited personal Hands. Factions and their uses are described in more detail on p. SQUARP.


### Pile

During Throwdowns, a **Pile** of cards temporarily exists in the middle of the table. Whenever a participant plays a card, they play it on top of the Pile, face-up. Long Throwdowns with many participants can create huge piles indeed.


### Trash

Each Deck has an associated **Trash** heap, which is a stack of face-up cards next to it on the table. When a card is discarded during play, it goes on top of the Trash heap of the relevant Deck, face-up.


## Card Details

***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** uses standard playing cards, available just about everywhere. The assumptions are:

* Basic rectangular playing cards, 54 in total
* Each card has a front (or face) with a different rank and suit on it.
* Each card has a back with an identical pattern, making the cards indistinguishable when looked at from behind.


### Face, Faces, and Facing

If you're not used to playing cards, the terms "face" and "facing" and "face cards" can be a bit confusing. Hopefully the following can make some of that easier:

* Every card has a Face and a Back. The Face shows the rank and suit of the card, while the Back shows the standard card backing pattern for that Deck.
* Some cards have *literal* faces on their faces, denoting them as Jacks, Queens, and Kings. While every card in the Deck has a face, these cards are *specifically* called Face Cards. They have number values of 11, 12, and 13, respectively.
* Finally, the term "facing" is used to denote the directional positioning of the card in play. For example, if a card is laying on the table with it's "face" side directed downward, then it is noted as "facing" down, or simply "face-down."


### The Suits

The four card Suits are primarily used to break ties and empower certain actions in Throwdowns. Suit order is Spades (highest), Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (lowest). Each suit has an associated **Suit Value** which is used by a handful of side mechanics: Spades = 4, Hearts = 3, Diamonds = 2, and Clubs = 1.


### Number Cards

The Numbered cards are ranked by value, with Two (2) being the lowest and Ten (10) being the highest.

Also, note that Twos are considered somewhat important in that by default they are the only cards that beat Aces (see below).


### Face Cards

Jacks, Queens, and Kings are typically played as number cards with values of 11, 12, and 13, respectively. They are also sometimes used in special Techs and other situations, making them a bit more valuable in the common play.


### Aces

Aces are the highest-ranked card in the Deck, with a functional rank of 14 in almost all cases, with one notable exception: when Coach flips for a Dissonance check, any Ace revealed has a value of 1.

However, Aces have a weakness against Twos. In a Gambit, a Two always beats an Ace. In a Throwdown, an Ace on top of the Pile can be beaten by a Two (and only a Two), and similarly cannot be played against a Two on the top of the Pile.


### Jokers

Four Joker cards are used as a special Pacing and Empowerment mechanic. The Jokers are always shuffled into their respective Decks *face-up*. When a Joker is revealed (by reaching the top of a Deck), immediately take it from its Deck and set it out face-up beside it for all to see. Jokers sitting forth in such a fashion are called **Omens**.

Omens in play exist in two states: Active (face-up) and Spent (face-down). When first revealed, they remain Active until used for one of the following purposes, based on their Deck of origin.

**Pilot Omens** can be Spent at any time by a Pilot to gain additional Charges. The Pilot first flips the Active Omen face-down, and then gets to choose: she can either the +Chargeup:Self(Full) or the +Chargeup:All(2) event triggers.

**Coach Omens** can be Spent by Coach to trigger Crisis events. These are explained in more detail in Coach's Handbook.

It is important to note that the buildup of *any* number of Omens can benefit several of Coach's Threats, so players are advised to spend their quickly.

Jokers are *never* sent to Play Piles or the Trash. Once both of a Deck's Jokers have been revealed and Spent, return them face-up to the Deck, then Reshuffle the Deck.


### "Wild" Cards

Some effects in the game may declare that a card is **Wild** for a time. When a card is played as Wild, it is played face-down, and its player declares it to function as any other standard (non-Joker) card.


## Card Terminology


### Discard

When the rules call for a card to be **discarded**, you must remove the card in question from its current place in play and place it face-up on top of the Trash. If an effect tells you to Discard, the card in question bypasses all other play locations and goes directly onto the Trash. Discards never count toward Play Pile totals.


### Draw

When you are told to **draw** a card, take the top card of your Deck and put it in your current active Hand of cards. Sometimes you may be told to "draw and immediately play" - in this case, that card skips your Hand and is played directly to the table. Outside of that specification, when you draw a card, it goes into your Hand before any subsequent actions or plays follow.


### Flip

The mechanics sometimes instruct you to **flip** one or more cards. If it's a single card, just flip it in place so that whichever side was previously facing the table (or "down") is now facing away from the table (or "up"). So if you're told to flip a card that is "face up" on the table, flip it so it is now "face down" in the same place.

If you are told to flip a *stack* of cards, first tidy up the stack in place so that all the cards neatly align, and then flip the entire stack as a single unit, so that the card that was facing towards the table is now facing away from it. Do *not* flip each card individually.


### Play

When the rules tell you to **play** a card, you take a card from your Hand and place it on the table in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, all card plays are performed face-up.

Sometimes you may see the sub-terms **Play-up** and **Play-down** in the test. These mean "play a card face up" and "play a card face down," respectively. Similarly, if the rules say that you "play down" or "play up" a card, those signify the orientation of the to-be-played card. But to repeat: unless otherwise stated, *all* Plays are performed face-up.

If the rules call for a "**blind**" play, you must play that card directly from the top of the Deck. Pull the card and immediately play it.


### Remove

*Very* occasionally the rules will call for a card to be **Removed from Play**. When this happens, take the card(s) in question and set them aside entirely. These cards do not go to Trash, and do not get reshuffled into the Deck. Unless otherwise specified, these cards remain out of play for the duration of the current *scenario*.


### Shuffle/Reshuffle

Whenever the rules call for a **Shuffle** or **Reshuffle** of a Deck, the Deck's owner picks up both the Deck and its Trash and then reshuffles them back together. Unless specific rules state otherwise, the following items are not typically reshuffled into the Deck during common reshuffles: Hands, Factions, Omens, Piles, Zones, etc - in other words, any other card locations that are not specifically the Deck or the Trash.



# +Triggers: Microevents

Much of the game is driven by a number of small self-contained mechanical processes called **Microevents**. Microevents are implemented as quick scripted "system calls" activated by "**+Trigger**" notations as consequences of the natural flow of game play. As these fire-and-forget subroutines are frequently triggered via myriad different game components, all of the microevents are tagged and collected in this section as a way of quickly referencing them.

Think of microevents like quick side mechanics, or small subroutines in code. When fired, each one makes a minor tweak or modification here or there, and then shuts down. While each event is called at various times by other, larger, more complicated game mechanics, they are not solely subservient to or isolated components of those greater processes.

Each microevent detailed here is likely to be triggered in multiple places throughout the rest of this document. You don't need to memorize them on a first-read - instead, we collect them here for ease of future reference.

Ultimately there are two main categories of microevents: those that trigger actions, and those that cause "damage" to other components.


##### On +Trigger Notations

Microevent triggers are always given with the same basic notation. The full extended format is: **+Triggername:Target** with the first part declaring the microevent being triggered, and the second part stating the recipient of that event. If the trigger is given without the ":Target" suffix, then the target is either implicit in the event or simply not applicable. The breakdown of valid targets is as follows:

* **Self:** apply effect to instigator of the trigger
* **Opponent:** apply to instigator's active opponent
* **Choice:** apply to instigator's choice of valid recipient
* **Each**: apply to every valid target currently in play

**Numbers:** Some triggers have an additional numerical notation, such as **+Triggername:Target(2)** or **+Triggername:Target(Full)**. This states that the target of the event receives a numerical modification based on the event. For example, **+Chargeup:Self(2)** implies that your Pilot gains two Charges, while **+Chargeup:Self(Full)** implies that your Charge gauge fills to maximum capacity. If no number is given, assume the base minimum effect for the trigger.

**Choices:** Occasionally, you may see a specific "+Damage:Choice" in the rules, such as "Coach may trigger +Damage:Choice." This means that the instigator can apply any single damage-type trigger of their choice against any valid target.


##### Microevent List:

We've listed them here for quick convenient reference. These are all explained in greater detail further below.

**Actions**

* **+BREAK!** = action that allows Coach to disrupt a Lesser Fusion
* **+Burn** = action that forces as target to discard their current Hand
* **+Chargeup** = action that allows a Pilot to accrue a Charge
* **+Favor** = action that allows a Pilot to invest into a Faction
* **+Fortify** = action that allows a Pilot to recover a spent Buffer token
* **+Rally** = action that increases Team Harmony by one level
* **+Rebuild** = action that allows the Team to repair a damaged Location
* **+Restore** = action that allows a Pilot to recover a lost Stat point
* **+Replenish** = action that allows a Pilot to boost a Team Resource
* **+Storm** = action that allows Coach to activate a Storm
* **+Tarry** = action that causes a Deck Discard to simulate the passage of time
* **+Wave** = action that allows Coach to activate a Wave

**Damage:**

* **+Disfavor** = damage to a Faction
* **+Purge** = damage to a Pilot's Charge gauge
* **+Ruin** = damages to a Location
* **+Schism** = damage to the team Harmony gauge
* **+Trauma** = damage to a Pilot by directly reducing their Commitment Stats


## Action Microevents


### +BREAK!

**Valid Targets:** Pilots in a Lesser Fusion

The heinous **+BREAK!** trigger allows Coach to disrupt an active Lesser Fusion.


### +Burn

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Coach

The **+Burn** trigger forces the target to discard their entire current Hand of cards. If this triggers during a conflict, do not redraw. If this triggers between conflicts, redraw to Max.


### +Chargeup

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Chargeup** trigger allows a Pilot to add points to her Charge gauge. Unless otherwise specified, by default the event adds a single Charge. If her Charges are already full, this has no effect.


### +Favor

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Locations

The **+Favor** trigger allows the Team to invest cards into a revealed Faction. Unless otherwise specified, by default the event allows a single card investment to a single Faction of their choice.

Alternately, Coach may allow a Pilot to use a +Favor event to remove an Offense token from a relevant Faction.

See p. SQUARP for full details on Factions and Favor.


### +Fortify

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Fortify** trigger allows a Pilot to recover a single previously-spent Buffer token. If her Buffer is already at max, then this has no effect.


### +Rally

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Rally** trigger allows the Pilots to raise their Harmony rating by 1, to a maximum of 7 (Violet). If a +Rally trigger would raise the Harmony above 7, instead leave it at 7 and trigger +Chargeup:Each to the entire Team.


### +Rebuild

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Locations

The **+Rebuild** trigger allows the team to repair a Damaged location, returning it to a Standing state. This cannot be used on Standing or Razed Locations.


### +Recover

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Recover** trigger allows a Pilot to restore a single point of a temporarily-lowered Commitment Stat. If her Commitments are undamaged, this has no effect. This does *not* restore permanent Commitment loss.


### +Replenish

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Resources

The **+Replenish** trigger allows the Pilots to add points to their Team Resources. Unless otherwise specified, by default the event increases a single Resource of their choice by +1. See p. SQUARP for full details on Team Resources.


### +Storm

**Valid Targets:** Coach (self)

The **+Storm** trigger allows Coach to activate any one Storm action on his scenario Threats. This can and likely will trigger other microevents. See p. SQUARP for full details on Waves and Storms.


### +Tarry

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Coach (self)

The game's time and Crisis mechanics will occasionally call for a **+Tarry** action, most commonly when the Pilots make use of certain Location boons, but also occasionally when they waste time arguing and Coach feels necessary to mechanically nudge them into action.

Tarry is a quick and simple Coach-specific card action. When triggered, Coach takes a number of cards from the top of his Deck equal to the current Crisis tier, and sends them directly to the Trash. This risks bringing the Deck ever closer to the revelation of another Omen (and potential escalation of Crisis!).


### +Wave

**Valid Targets:** Coach (self)

The **+Wave** trigger allows Coach to activate any one Wave action on his scenario Threats. This can and likely will trigger other microevents. See p. SQUARP for full details on Waves and Storms.


## Damaging Microevents

(usually have a target stated; can usually be mitigated with Buffer tokens, within limits; etc)


##### Payloads: On "Stacking" Damage

(**PLAYTEST NOTE:** I feel this may need further clarification, but we'll see)

During "Open Play" of the game, damage-type +Triggers are usually resolved immediately upon their activation. Unless otherwise noted, all damage-type +Triggers "stack" when multiple instances accrue at the same time. Multiple simultaneous +Triggers is very rare in Open Play, but there are chances they might occur due to multiple Pilots triggering them simultaneously. When a number of identical damage triggers fire off at once, they must then all be resolved at once as well, in the order they were triggered. If there is no clear order, resolve them in the order the Team sees fit.

During Throwdowns, however, damage-type +Triggers are instead added to each side's relevant growing **Payload** stacks, to be applied altogether at the end of the conflict. The exceptions to this are a rare few abilities which specifically state that their effects are **immediate**. In these cases, resolve the +Triggers at the moment they occur, and do not add them to the Payloads.


### +Disfavor

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Factions

The **+Disfavor** trigger targets a revealed Faction, adding a single Offense token to that Faction's card. When a Faction reaches the third Offense, it is either removed from play or converted into a Threat (Coach's choice). See p. SQUARP for full details on Factions and Offenses.

By default, the team can spend points from the Fan Club to mitigate +Disfavor events, one token per Offense prevented.


### +Purge

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Purge** trigger targets a Pilot, forcing them to erase their current buildup of Charges.

By default, any Pilot can spend her Buffers to prevent a +Purge that targets her, one token per Purge prevented.


### +Ruin

**Valid Targets:** Locations

The **+Ruin** trigger targets a Location, and its effect depends on that Location's current state. If the Location is currently Standing, +Ruin forces it to flip to a Damaged state. If the Location is already Damaged, +Ruin forces it to a Razed state. A Razed location cannot be targeted by +Ruin.


### +Schism

**Valid Targets:** Pilots

The **+Schism** trigger hurts the Pilots by damaging their central team Harmony. Each time anyone in the team either triggers on their own or is otherwise afflicted with +Schism, the Team's Harmony is reduced by 1 rank. Harmony can never be reduced below 1 (Red); each instance of +Schism acquired while "in the Red" subsequently triggers +Trauma:Each to the *entire* team. See p. SQUARP for full details on Harmony.

By default, any Pilot can spend her Buffers to prevent +Schism that she personally either triggers or is targeted by, one token per point of loss prevented.


### +Trauma

**Valid Targets:** Pilots, Threats

The **+Trauma** trigger is the primary method for applying direct damage to both Pilots and Threats.

**Pilots:** Against Pilots, it damages them by temporarily lowering their six core Stats. Each time a Pilot suffers +Trauma, she must temporarily reduce a Stat rank of her choosing by 1 point. A Stat cannot be reduced below Zero (0) ranks. Reducing a stat also reduces the balance maximum of its parent Commitment. For more info on managing Stat and Commitment loss, see "*Pilots: Commitments & Attributes*" (p. XX).

**Threats:** Against Threats, this trigger directly lowers the enemy's Threat Rating. If a Threat's Rating is reduced to Zero (0), it is defeated and removed from play.

**Both:** Pilot and Threats can spend Buffer tokens to prevent +Trauma that targets or affects them, at a cost of one token per point of damage prevented.


# Conflict Type 1: Fiat ("Just say what happens")

Now that you've read all about the nuances of using the cards, here's how to completely ignore them! You see, not every conflict needs to involve the cards, Strike Ranges, +Triggers, or any other mechanics. If there's a conflict at hand and you (any of you) think that you can get away with it, make a pitch to just say what happens and move on. This applies to all players, Pilots and Coach alike. If either side feels that an action taken by the other should be contested, they should say so of course and bring out the cards. But otherwise just keep role-playing and push forward with the scene, no cards required.

In fact, as a Pilot it's generally a good idea to keep this approach in your mind at all times. Instead of always *asking* Coach if you *can* do something, just tell him what you're *going to* do, and even how you want it to go down. If Coach feels that your actions are contested enough to require card play, then he'll tell you as such, otherwise he'll let it slide and you get the results you were seeking - or he may instead offer you a modified version of that, or even casually negotiate it with you. In other words, you are encouraged to take the initiative and actively push your Pilots' personal and team story agendas, and not worry about asking permission for every single action you wish to take. Try it out - you may be pleased with the results!



# Conflict Type 2: The Gambit

But now let's get back to the card-talk! The **Gambit** is the simplest (and likely the most common) card-based conflict in the game. Understanding the Gambit is foundational to understanding the flow of the entire rest of the game's mechanics.

Gambits tend to fall into two general uses during play: uncontested feats of the Pilots' abilities, and isolated, one-off micro-conflicts where Coach feels that the Pilot's attempt at action may cause interesting and unforeseen story repercussions. These are typically triggered when a player wants to do something challenging, but not necessarily worthy of a full-blown Throwdown - in other words, when the outcome of an event is uncertain, but Coach doesn't feel it necessary to involve the time or effort of a full round-table conflict process.

Gambits are meant to be very quick in play, and use the following structure:

1. Initiation
2. Play
3. Outcome

In short, Coach issues the challenge for a Gambit. The pilot accepts by playing *or* flipping a card, with the ultimate goal of beating a secret card played by Coach.


## Initiation

**To initiate a Gambit,** Coach states some variant of "that action's going to require a Gambit," or "that's a good question, we should Gambit to find out," letting the Pilot know that if she pushes forward with her plan, cards are going to be involved. The Pilot should then consider whether or not she wants to take that risk. The choice is *always* the Pilot's - in other words, Coach can never force a Gambit upon a Pilot.


## Play

Should the Pilot accept the challenge, Coach then plays a card face-down to the table. This card can be from his own Hand, or can instead be played blind from the top of the Deck. The value of this **Threshold Card** will set the Threshold for the Gambit, but the Pilot does not know what it is before she plays.

The Pilot must then either play-up a card of her choice from her own Hand (or a visible Faction), or instead flip one from the top of the Deck (if she's feeling lucky or doesn't want to waste her cards). Her goal is to equal or exceed the still-unknown Threshold that Coach's card created.


## Outcome

Once the Pilot makes her play, Coach reveals the Threshold card. Compare the Pilot's Play to the Threshold, with final results as follows:

If **the Pilot's card value is *higher*,** then the player achieves a **"Yes, and..."** result. The Pilot succeeds at the intended task, and gets to narrate some additional boon as well!

**In any other outcome,** the Pilot gets to choose one of the following three options:

* **Yes, but...**
* **No, but...**
* **No, *and*...** (+Chargeup)

With this outcome, your success or failure will always be accompanied by some kind of different side effect.

The extended details are below. Once the cards are revealed and the outcome is determined, the Gambit is complete. Discard the cards and move on with play.


### "Yes, and..."

With a "Yes, and..." result, the Pilot has gone beyond what was needed, and attained unexpected rewards for her gamble with fate. The Pilot's immediate goal is attained, and Coach additionally decides on a bonus "consequence" to the action. This should be some kind of helpful or otherwise positive boon to their situation. Positive Consequence examples:

* A beneficial narrative effect, such as a new clue, a newly-revealed ally, or the discovery of some new avenue to attain a personal goal.
* The Pilot can trigger a single-point positive trigger to herself or a relevant target involved in the scope of the Gambit: +Chargeup, +Favor, +Fortify, +Rebuild, +Recover, or +Replenish (others require more effort that a single Gambit, however)


### "Yes/No, but..."

"Yes, but..." and "No, but..." results represent unexpected consequences to the Pilot's actions. The former indicates that they attained their goal but suffer a negative consequence. The latter indicates that the Pilot has failed at their task, but gained another unexpected positive consequence instead (see the options above). Similar to "Yes, and..." results, in either case the bonus consequences should be "lesser" in nature, and not total game-changers. Negative Consequence examples:

* A deleterious narrative effect, such as in-story setbacks to the Pilot's goals, possessions, or immediate safety.
* One of Coach's Threats activates a Wave
* Coach triggers one of the following damaging events: +Disfavor, +Purge, +Strife


### "No, *and*..."

The third and final choice of a "failed" Gambit attempt may seem like an unusual one. By choosing a "No, and..." outcome, you not only fail to accomplish the goal at hand, but you *also* suffer some other negative side effect as well (see examples above). This is an *entirely* voluntary choice, letting any player who so chooses suffer double-defeat.

Why in humanity would a Pilot ever choose this option? Well, there is one speck of silver lining in this otherwise dismal cloud of failure: **When you choose the "No, and..." outcome, you also immediately activate +Chargeup:Self.** By choosing a deeper failure state, you at least gain some power from it as consolation, so it's not all bad!


### Playbook Gambit Specialties

Each Playbook has her own unique "Gambit Specialty" role-playing trigger. Whenever this specialty is involved in a Gambit, the player always gets a *second* "and" in their outcome, which adds an additional consequential effect of the same type already chosen. This always results in either two positives, or two negatives. It breaks down as follows:

1. "Yes, and (something positive), *and* (something else positive)."
2. "Yes, but (something negative), *and* (something else negative)."
3. "No, but (something positive), *and* (something else positive)."
4. "No, and (something negative), *and* (something else negative)." **Special:** In addition to the bonus +Chargeup already triggered by this choice, when a Specialty is involved the Pilot *also* gets to record a new Lesson.

**Please take note: *This isn't optional*.** If a Pilot's specialty is involved, she *must* include the additional "and" effect.


## Strike Ranges in Gambits

Strike Range is a mechanic that has been mentioned before but not yet fully introduced as of this point in the book. Greater details on this mechanic are found on p. SQUARP. For now, this note exists only to clarify a major point: Strike Ranges *do not* apply to Gambits. If ever you have any questions about that, refer back to this section for written proof.


## PVP Gambits?

Gambits are meant to be quick resolution to questions of fate, put forth by Coach to Challenge the Pilots. As such, Gambits do not involve Pilot vs Pilot conflicts. If two or more Pilots have beef with each other and feel that cards are required to resolve it, but don't feel like it needs to be a full Throwdown, then as far as this game is concerned the issue doesn't actually require cards. In PVP situations, either narratively agree on what happens, or take it to a Throwdown.


# Conflict Type 3: The Throwdown

When fiat won't do, and a quick card-draw still isn't enough to resolve a story conflict, there's only one option left: it's time to throw down.

In ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!***, the **Throwdown** is the big extended mechanic used to resolve all manner of intense and involved multi-character conflicts. After school fights, galactic space battles, championship debate team bouts, robo vs monster beat-downs, volleyball tournaments and more, all are played out with a Throwdown.


## Throwdown Basics

In a Throwdown, two sides of a conflict square off against each other in a multi-round exchange of cards. As cards are played, narrations are applied, and agendas are pushed, the stakes grow ever higher until one side finally concedes - either by choice or by complete lack of any other options.

The end goal of every Throwdown is twofold. First, "winning" a Throwdown gives the victor greater (if not total) control of the narrative outcome of the conflict. There are times when the margin of success is slim, resulting in the loser also getting some say in what happens, but ultimately the resulting story benefits the victor the most.

Second is the mechanical outcome, the more tangible spoils of conflict. Depending on the stakes in play, Throwdowns can cause or heal damage, hurt or restore Team Harmony and Resources, affect Factions or Locations, damage Threats, and more.

For playtest purposes, I'll try to keep this simple and without colorful text. Understanding the concept of the "Strike Range" (also simply known as "Strike") is crucial to mastering the strategy of Throwdowns.

**Pilots:** When you use the Counter action, you must play a card of higher numerical rank than your opponent's last-played card (i.e. the card currently on top of the Pile). There is technically no limit on how high of a rank that card can be, but there is an incentive to keeping the differences between the cards low. This is because playing too high has the chance of damaging your Team's Harmony. This is represented through your Pilot's *Strike Range*, which is determined at the start of every new Throwdown.

Your Strike sets the maximum "safe" difference in ranks by which your Counter card can exceed your opponent's. As long as the difference is within this range, your play is "safe" (or "Resonant") and suffers no innate adverse effect.

> For example, if your opponent played a Two (2), and your Strike is 2, then you can safely play a Three (3) or Four (4) without additional consequence.

You *can* play higher than this Range, but doing so risks Harmony loss. When you do so, the play is called **Dissonant** and the resulting difference between the ranks, lowered by your Strike range, is called **Dissonance**.

> Carrying forward the above example, if you instead played a King (13) against your opponent's Two (2), that's a difference of 11! Your Strike of 2 mitigates that somewhat, resulting in a Dissonance value of 9.

If a Strike is Dissonant, Coach immediately Flips up a card. If its value is equal to or less than the Dissonance, you've triggered an immediate +Schism. If not, the play is safe, the flip is discarded, and the action moves onward. Aces are considered to have a value of One (1) for this flip.

> Concluding the above example, with a calculated Dissonance of 9, if Coach's subsequent flip has a rank of Nine (9) or lower, you've triggered +Schism. If that Schism is not prevented (such as by spending a Buffer token), then your Team's Harmony is immediately lowered one step!

Note that some Techs and Gear can increase your Strike temporarily, including the basic Charge Techs that all Pilots can use. I encourage you to apply them wisely.

**Coach:** Your Strikes are *hard* limits. Unless specified otherwise (by a Threat power, for example), you cannot play outside of your calculated Strike. This is intentional: as Coach, you have more overall available power to wield, mitigated by hard limits via a tight mechanical leash.


## Step 1: Initiating the Challenge

Be you Pilot or Coach, to start a Throwdown you must take a card from your Hand and slam it face-down on the table. Accompany this action with a description of how you are challenging your opponent, such as "I step in and grab the bully's swinging fist before she can hit my friend!" or "The guard swings his gun to point at you, telling you to stand down!" or even the simple but effective "Bring it!"

The challenged opponent must then likewise take a card from their own Hand and place it face-down, similarly narrating their acceptance of the challenge.

Initiative cards can only be played directly from Hands (and not Factions). Neither side may draw a replacement for this card until the Throwdown has been resolved.


### Initiative Strategy

**Pilots:** Initiative is played half-blind, but still beholden to Strike Range. You want to play high, but not *too* high, because you want to beat your opponent, but not by too big of a margin.


### Refusing the Challenge

If you refuse the challenge, then you allow your opponent's goals in the moment to go unimpeded. This can be pretty disastrous in high stakes situations, and can even include your character's own death, so I hope you know what you're doing.


## Step 2: Establishment Questions

Misc questions for the pilots similar to duels in Moto:


### Pick Sides and Declare Leaders

There are two sides to every Throwdown, usually Coach vs Pilots but also occasionally Pilots vs Pilots instead. All players who wish to be involved should declare what side they are fighting on..

Each side must also declare a Throwdown Leader. This player is responsible for managing the flow of their side of the action, and also gains the benefit of additional potential bonus draws. Others can back up their leaders with their own actions, but only the Leader gets bonus draws at the start. Note that by backing up a Leader, you also expose yourself to consequences should your side lose.

The Leader role is most often given to whichever member of the conflict that either started the fight, or was instead specifically targeted by whoever else started the fight. This is usually an obvious choice, but if not, take a moment to discuss and set roles.

Note that Throwdown Leader is a temporary role, and does not need to be connected to the established Team social hierarchy in any way unless the players wish to do so. In other words, Red doesn't have to be the leader of every throwdown, and in fact the game is more fun if she frequently just assists!


### Does She Fight for Her Team, or for Herself?

For each Pilot that is leading a side of the Throwdown, Coach should ask every *other* player at the table, as a group: "Does this Pilot currently fight for her own goals, or for those of her Team?"

Other players should answer aloud and honestly. The answer both sets crucial tone for the fight, and also determines how many bonus cards that Pilot will draw. If there's a voting tie, Coach breaks it.


### Who Started this Fight?

The answer to this question is usually pretty obvious, but it requires acknowledgement, as it determines the Pilots' Strike Range base. If this is ever somehow in question, default to the side that put down the first Initiative card.


### Determine Draws and Strike Ranges

**Pilots:**

* **Bonus Draw (Pilot Leader Only):** Based on the answer to above questions. If you fight for the Team, your draw equals your Synch stat. If you fight for yourself, your draw equals your Solo stat.
* **Strike Ranges:** Based on who started the fight. If your team started the action, members each use their own Steel stats. If the fight was brought to them, they use their Flesh stats instead.

**Coach:**

* **Bonus Draws:** Coach draws the invested cards from the stacks of each of his present-and-involved Threats.
* **Strike Range:** Coach's Strike Range is equal to the Threat Rating of the highest-rated involved Threat, plus one for each additional Threat involved.


### Draw and Redistribute Hands

With all the establishment settled, it's time to draw.

**Pilots:** First the leader draws cards = her bonus draw, determined above. Then, all other involved Pilots on her team can choose to give the leader any number of cards from their own current Hands. Finally, the leader must then give those Pilots back an equal number of cards (but they don't need to be the same ones).

**Coach:** Draw your Bonus draw as stated above, you are now ready to play.


## Step 3: Resolve Initiative

Both sides now turn their initiative cards face-up for all to see, and the Higher card (by rank, then suit) wins the initiative.

Don't forget to check Strike Range! If a Pilot wins but their strike is outside Range, Coach checks against Dissonance. And if *Coach* wins but their card is outside range, discard it, and the Pilot wins Initiative without Dissonance, regardless of their own card.

In the extremely rare case of the cards being identical in both rank *and* suit (i.e. the exact same card), either call the whole thing off, or simultaneously play new initiative cards until someone wins.

In any case, discard all cards other than the winning card.

This winning Initiative Card cannot be Blocked, and is immune to any special game effects that would force a discard.


## Step 4: Play Rounds

Play in one to three rounds of escalating stakes:

1. The Confrontation
2. The Struggle
3. The Final Attack

Each side goes back and forth in exchanges of turns, playing and escalating until one side concedes.


### Taking Turns

### Taking Actions

Pilots: each involved Pilot can take a single action per turn. One and only one of those actions must be a Play action. The other involved Pilots can take Support actions to assist the chosen Play action. Once the chosen Play Action has been completed, the turn passes onward.

Coach: TBD


#### Play Actions

* Counter: play a card of higher rank than the topmost card on the Pile
* Block: play a card of equal rank but higher suit than the topmost card on the Pile
* Escalate: push current Pile aside, start new pile with higher stakes
* Concede: put cards down, declare opponent the victor. If you cannot Counter, Block, or Escalate, you must Concede.

##### Counter

* **Type:** Play
* **Turn Passes:** To opponent.


##### Block

* **Type:** Play
* **Turn Passes:** To opponent.


##### Escalate

* **Type:** Play
* **Turn Passes:** To opponent.


##### Concede

* **Type:** Play
* **Turn Passes:** N/A. Throwdown concludes, resolve Outcome.



#### Support Actions

Any other involved Pilot on the Team side can choose to perform a Support Action. They must discard any card from their Hand, which allows them to do one of the following:

* Use one of their Charge Techs to assist another Pilot's Play
* Activate Gear to assist another Pilot's Play
* ...and more to be decided
