# Coach's Handbook

This whole section is a big ol' Work in Progress. Essentially the "How to GM" section of the text.


## Coaching Tips

(**Playtest:** Unsorted Advice)


### You Are Not the Enemy!

As Coach, your primary role is arbiter (of the rules), narrator (of the world), and challenger (of the opposition). One thing that is very specifically excluded from this list is Antagonist. While you may control the forces that oppose the Pilots, your job is not to destroy them, but instead to challenge them. You guide the actions of their enemies, but you must do so fairly, and not take pleasure in the Pilot's defeats or suffering.


### Draw Inspiration from the Genre

**Watch a lot of mecha anime!**


### You Don't Have to Fight the Formula...

**The source genre is pretty formulaic, but that's okay!** In the classic stories, the Pilots go off on side missions, make deals, and get in sword fights until the inevitable arrival of the Big Giant Monster of the Week, after which they go all Final Form and kick its butt. This is pretty standard for the genre, and there's nothing wrong with that. The shows keep following that formula because it works, and players of this game will likewise expect it. It's fun, it's comfortable, and it entertains.

What I'm saying here is that you should not feel pressured to avoid the "railroad" style of play in this game. It's practically expected in these stories, and following that flow will make your first few scenarios a lot easier to manage. Stick with the tracks as you learn, they're there to guide you along your journey.


### ...But Sometimes You've Got to Break Free!

Once you've mastered the formula, feel free to totally break from it when you see a good opportunity to do so. That's exactly what the Crisis Paths are for. Using the defaults is fun for a while, but if you keep at them over and over the play can get a little stale. While the basic flow usually assumes that the Pilots spend time pursuing personal goals and gathering power before the inevitable BGM shows up, you don't *have* to follow that pattern every single time.

Using your Crisis Paths, switch it up from time to time. Have the BGM attack sooner than they might expect, fully planning for it to totally devastate them. After it's done, spend the rest of the scenario focusing on them trying to recover and rebuild from a major defeat. Or instead have multiple successive BGM attacks take place across the story. Keep them working at it, desperately trying to save humanity from destruction!

Your BGM doesn't even have to be a Big Giant Monster, either. The BGM at its mechanical core is really nothing more than a set of abilities that get used in the Robo Rumbles against the Pilots' assembled Final Form. None of those mechanics actually *require* it to be a "Monster" at all. The players will probably expect a horrible space creature... but what if a Fleet of Alien Spaceships shows up instead? Or what if it's actually a planetary defense system they have to defeat, or a sentient black hole, or even a shadow copy of their own Final Form? Maybe the Pilots have gone rogue, and the "BGM" is in fact the assembled Earth Armada trying to destroy them! The same mechanics apply, and your group's story will benefit from the switch-up.

An even more unexpected change is to exclude the BGM from your scenario entirely! If the players expect a Big Giant Monster to show up at the end of every story, they'll get comfortable in rote patterns of development. By excluding the BGM from your Crisis path, you can spend a scenario or two focusing instead on completely different aspects of the world. Sometimes the core conflict of a story isn't the monsters, but instead the smaller, more personal battles that the Pilots have to fight. Skip the BGM for a game, focus on the personal stories entirely, and you will both surprise the players and also keep the rhythm fresh.


### Keep Them on their Toes

Don't let the team get too comfortable with their synergies! Let them enjoy a solid round-table full-party victory every now and then, but don't let them grow complacent with their killer combos. Put in challenges that split them up, like multiple fronts of enemies, or simultaneous conflicts that require divided attention.

Similarly, don't let individual Pilots get too cozy with one-trick pony shows. If a Pilot is too specced out on Assists, for example, put her in the hot seat from time to time where she needs to overcome challenges all by her lonesome. Conversely, if a "lone wolf" pilot is too cocky, throw her against an obstacle that requires teamwork.


### Use Your Threes and Sevens

Three and Seven are the best numbers. They are common in the source fiction, and great for immediate use in play. If you need a quick number in the story, use threes and sevens. The Pilots need to activate three terminals to get inside the secret enemy base underneath the ruins, inside of which seven horrible beasts await them. Seven thuggish rivals jump the lone Pilot when she stays late at the gym to shoot some hoops, and they leave three important items behind in their rush to escape after she whoops their butts. Three groups of seven alien fighter ships block the Team's travel to their mission location, which happens to be in a rare trinary star system.

Once the players are used to your threes and sevens, throw them for a spin with a sudden five or six!


### Factions, Threats, and Non-Player Characters

Does Everyone Have to be a Faction or Threat? Easy answer: No, they don't! In ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!***, the only characters that have game mechanics are the Pilots, the Factions, and the Threats. But there are many other characters and creatures in the universe that don't need to fall into these categories. The vast majority of these exist as little more than narrative color, but sometimes you can use them as the components of other game mechanics.

The easiest way to bring in non-mechanics characters is as narrative power behind a Gambit. For example, if a Pilot has offended the locals of a backwoods colony and they are trying to lynch her, instead of statting them out you can just use them as the crux of a Gambit. Can she talk them out of their furor? Can she run away? Can she call on her friends' help in time? Play out a quick Gambit and find out!

Or instead, you can just "say what happens" and move on. There's no need to bring numbers and mechanics into play unless it's important to the greater story. For example, if a Pilot is out on a shopping trip in the Enzirian Bazaar and wants to find something interesting, role-play her interactions with the locals, and describe the fancy new scarf she gets from a pleasant off-world trader. Keep it simple, and enjoy the scenery for a while.

Similarly, you can use this same method to build up the feeling of danger in a purely descriptive way. For example, while the Pilots are making their way through monstrous caves on an alien planet, suddenly you describe how a young larval centipede-thing attacks them! Instead of throwing down a card, though, see how they respond, and just play it out with words. Let them blast it to smithereens and kick its carcass down a deep pit and move on. Bring more and more of these things into the scene, until you eventually reach a point where you finally feel that it's Throwdown time.


## Coach's Basic Mechanics

(**Still in Development**) Most of the in-game rules that Coach uses have already been detailed in their relative sections prior. This section here is meant to serve as a quick collection of page references to those bits and pieces.


### Coach's Differences

Coach plays the game very differently than the Pilots. Below are the major mechanical process changes that apply to your role in ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!***

**Coach's Hand:** Coach's Max Hand is set equal to the number of Pilot Players in the current game session.

**Charges:** Coach doesn't spend Charges to empower his own Techs (aka Waves and Storms) during Throwdowns. Instead, you *Discard* from your Hand in order to activate these options (Faces for Waves, Aces for Storms).

**Strike Ranges:** Coach has different limits in regard to Strike Ranges. Unlike the Pilots, who have the ability to play outside of Strike Ranges by risking team stress, by default your Threats are hard-limited by Strike Range and cannot play outside of them. Some of your custom Threats may have specific exemptions to this, however.

**Factions:** TBD

**Locations:** TBD


### Coach's Common Tasks

(this will end up being a master reference list of Coach's common tasks)

How to...

* Build a Big Giant Monster: p. SQUARP
* Check for Faction Disfavor: p. SQUARP
* Create a Threat: p. SQUARP
* Introduce a Faction: p. SQUARP
* Run a First Contact: p. SQUARP
* Run a Gambit: p. SQUARP
* Run a Lessons Vote: p. SQUARP
* Run a Throwdown: p. SQUARP


### Keeping Records

Coach should keep track of:

* Each player's various Triggers (from Chroma)
* Team Class Rank (based on the mode value across the team)
* Current Team Resources
* Threats


### Keeping Time Moving

Time and Urgency of the Mission are important aspects of play. The Pilots can choose to go off and do whatever they ultimately want, but if they linger inactive for too long, the enemy grows more powerful as the heroes idle. Occasionally if you feel like the Pilots are screwing around too much with unimportant stuff, or just overly turtling up, subtly remind them that danger is always near, and steer them toward action.

If they still don't get the hint, you can just invoke the **+Tarry** trigger, to subtly let them know that the clock is ticking.


### Waves and Storms - REWRITE 2018

Waves and Storms are Coach's special actions that he can take at predetermined times in order to make the Pilots' lives more complicated and dangerous. Waves tend to have smaller and/or more direct and localized effects. Storms are much more heinous, and frequently broad-reaching.

Waves and Storms come directly from the Threats in any particular scenario. High- and/or Multi-Threat scenarios will likely have multiple Wave and Storm options.

When the rules call for a Wave or Storm, you can only trigger *one* of those available to you, unless the rules specifically say otherwise.

Regardless of the mechanics, every wave and storm *must* have a suitable narrative description. Coach can't just say "Okay, I do a Wave, so Janys takes 1 damage" and move on. You must describe what exactly is happening in the story that is causing this damage. This can be tricky for those unexpectedly triggered by Crisis Path events, but by keeping aware of your Threats and their abilities, you should be able to come up with some ideas.

Every Scenario comes default with a basic Wave and Storm event built-in. All others come from custom Threats in the Scenario.

Waves and Storms are primarily triggered by three events during play:

* Crisis Path Steps (aka Omens)
* Throwdown "Trigger" Actions (require discards of faces or aces)
* Some Threat actions




# Coach: Meta-Game Structure

Most of the rest of this text talks about mechanics and numbers and math and gee whiz, but this section here is about managing the greater meta-flow of sessions and scenarios.

If you've made it this far, you've probably figured out that ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** has a somewhat different approach to a lot of the same tasks as other RPGs. However, the biggest hurdle for new players tends to be figuring out the expected flow of process. Hopefully this section can help you get over those bumps and smooth out your play experience.

Contained within are details on the basic game structure for the two expected modes of play: Campaign Mode, and One-Shot Mode.


## Campaign Mode

In Campaign play, you are all expecting to play this story for multiple sessions. I've found that 13 sessions or so tends to be a good story arc, and with proper adjudication of Lessons and Evolution votes, this can see the original Pilots grow into very capable characters - provided they live that long, of course.


### Session 1: First Contact and Creation

Campaigns work best if the group spends the entire first meetup session just talking about the game they want to play, and the story they want to tell. During that process, they should run through the **First Contact** tutorial scene, and then afterward make their characters together as a group.


#### Start with a Blank Slate

This means story *and* rules! Don't pre-write the world details, and likewise don't front-load the rules! Trust in the First Contact scene to kickstart both story and rules knowledge, and you'll be good to go.


#### Run the First Contact

The First Contact kicks off the game and the grander story. It is both tutorial and world-building session. Every game should begin with one *before* the actual player character Pilots are even discussed at all.


#### Run the Team Creation Sequence

After the First Contact, run the Team Creation process. Coach's involvement with this will largely be one of mechanical guidance and "story wrangling," as you ask questions of the group and encourage them to add more details to the world.

When determining the details of the time between the First Contact and the start of the game, help them bridge that story gap with more questions and ideas.

Keep in mind that the default game intends for the characters to all be young Pilots fresh in Battle School. If this is a brand new group of ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** players, I highly encourage everyone to play young neophytes, so they can all experience the new developments together. However, if you have some veteran players, you might consider letting them play more established Pilots, possibly even those who survived the First Contact, if it was recent enough.


#### Optional: Enhance Creation with Helper Tools

In recent years, a number of really fantastic gaming tools have become available, several of which greatly enhance the process of character creation in a new game. One tool in particular that I am very fond of is a deck of *Backstory Cards* produced by Galileo Games. These cards work particularly well with ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** games, as they follow a round-table flow of story establishment very compatible with the extended action flow in Gattai. There's even a sci-fi themed expansion for the deck, which adds more thematic components fitting for exactly this kind of game.

This game is not affiliated in any way with Galileo Games, but I've used their cards so heavily in my own campaigns that I wanted to mention them here as a valuable possible addition to yours.


#### End the Session There

With the First Contact scene and the subsequent team creation complete, you should now have the foundation of an exciting new game world, and a promising new team of Pilots to explore it. I recommend concluding the first session at this point, so you have time to plan out the first game scenario and have it ready for the next session of play.


### Sessions 2-4: The First Mission

TBD (pending final scenario design rules section)

Things to cover:

* the first scenario
* slowly introduce more of the extended rule systems
* take your time!


### Sessions 5 and Beyond: Campaign Play

TBD

Things to cover:

* Usually anywhere from 3-7 scenarios in a standard 13-episode campaign


## One-Shot Mode

TBD (extended advice on running one-shot sessions and convention games, pending final stage playtesting process notes conversion)



# Coach: Scenario Development

(major development in progress)

To develop a scenario:

* Develop a Premise
* Add Factions and Locations
* Develop Threats
* Develop the Crisis Path
* Develop a Downtime Draw Table (or use the standard)
* Finalize Waves and Storms

This is presented as an ordered process, but you will most likely skip back and forth between them, as ideas and developments in later steps re-inform prior decisions.


## Step 1: Develop the Premise

TBD

Includes:

* Come up with a situation
* Add additional intra-team conflicts
* Write team buy-in questions


## Step 2: Add Factions and Locations

TBD

Prepare a Faction card for each Faction of the scenario, to be placed on the table when it is discovered by the Pilots.

Similarly prepare behind-the-scene Threat stats for any Faction that may potentially be a Threat to the players.


## Step 3: Develop Threats

TBD

(defined in own chapter for now, see below)

The Threats present in your scenario directly affect its design. Every Scenario should have a "Total Threat Rating" which is an "X/Y/Z" number. X = total number of Threats, Y = Average Threat Rating of those Threats, and Z = number of Threats designated as BGMs. Threats give Waves and Storms.

Threats are more fully explained in the next chapter, starting on p. SQUARP


## Step 4: Develop the Crisis Path

The Crisis Path is a pre-scripted series of event triggers that make the game more dangerous (and interesting!) for the Pilots.


### Building the Path

When you create a new scenario to run, you must build out your Crisis Path. The default path is thirteen steps, alternating initially between your pre-scripted Story Events and your Threats' Waves and Storms, and increasing in intensity over time until the inevitable attack of the Big Giant Monster.

Below is the "standard" default Crisis Path setup. Each "stanza" of four events gets steadily more intense, pushing the drama pretty hard toward the end.

| Omens Spent | Event               |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 1           | Story Event         |
| 2           | Wave                |
| 3           | Story Event         |
| 4           | Storm               |
| 5           | Story Event + Wave  |
| 6           | Wave                |
| 7           | Story Event + Wave  |
| 8           | Storm               |
| 9           | Story Event + Wave  |
| 10          | Storm               |
| 11          | Story Event + Storm |
| 12          | Wave                |
| 13          | BGM ATTACKS         |

**Playtest Note:** You can add whatever you want to your Path, really. As more playtest data is received, I hope to be able to codify this, and have a greater formula for overall Scenario difficulty. Until then, play around with these, try different combos, and see what works and what doesn't.


#### One-Shot Games

We've presented an alternate shorter 7-step version for Coaches who want to run a much quicker story. It's meant for a standard single-session game, such as a pick-up game or a convention session. If you have new players, you might event want to reduce this to 5 or 6 steps, while experienced players who push through the Deck quickly might instead warrant extending it to 8, 9, or even 10.

A standard one-shot Path is:

| Omens | Event        |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | Wave         |
| 2     | Wave         |
| 3     | Storm        |
| 4     | Wave         |
| 5     | Wave         |
| 6     | Storm        |
| 7     | BGM Attacks! |

A "Steady and Hard" more difficult path is:

| Omens | Event         |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | Wave          |
| 2     | Wave          |
| 3     | Storm         |
| 4     | Storm         |
| 5     | Storm + Wave  |
| 6     | Storm + Storm |
| 7     | BGM Attacks!  |

To provide suitable challenge for one-shot Robo Rumbles, add the BGM's Threat rating to Coach's Hand Limit and Draw on each round.


### Triggering the First Event

You can trigger the first item on the Crisis Path at any time outside of an active card conflict, without requiring the use of an Omen. You are encouraged to do this early on in the first play session or a new scenario, in order to set its story in motion.

Additionally, since the +Tarry event is based on the current Crisis level, you will want to get it raised to level 1 before the Pilots start using any Location benefits. However, if they are starting off at low resources or otherwise in dire straits, you may instead wish to let them have a few freebies and relax a bit while they set their own stories in motion.


### Moving Along the Path

As the cards move during play, Jokers that reach the top of a Deck enter play as Active Omens, face-up next to their Decks. The owners of these respective Decks can Spend their Active Omens to perform side-specific actions. The Pilots' Omens are explained earlier in this text, while yours are explained here.

At any point outside of an active conflict, you can Spend one or both of your Active Omens by flipping it to its face-down state. Doing so triggers the next one or two events on the Crisis Path. Your Jokers are not returned to your Deck until both have been revealed *and* spent, at which point both are returned face-up and your Deck is reshuffled.

This builds a rough structure for pacing right into the game, while also giving you a bit of leeway as Coach on how to time these events for maximum impact. While it is technically possible to sit on the unspent Omens for as long as you want, we highly recommend spending them whenever you can, so as to get more tension and action into the game, and better move the story along!

Once you've reached the end of the path, that *usually* means the Big Monster finally attacks, but that doesn't mean that the Omens stop! Keep them flowing through the Deck as normal. Whenever you spend Omens from then on, they can be Waves (by spending one) or Storms (by spending two).


### Crisis and the Big Giant Monster

The current Crisis has a direct impact on the power of the Big Giant Monster, whenever it is eventually encountered, because the BGM's Hand is directly increased in size by the Crisis level.

Additionally, "by the book" the BGM can't attack (as in initiating a Rumble) until that level of the Crisis has been reached. You can always push it lower on the path if you like, but that remains to be tested in play.


## Step 5: Develop a Downtime Draw-Table

(TBD: a draw-table of events that happen between scenarios and potentially alter team Harmony, threats, and more. Should be an equal balance of good and bad things. 13 total options, one for each rank, with each option giving four different outcomes based on suit)


## Step 6: Finalize Waves and Storms

Every Scenario comes default with two free basic actions:

* The **Basic Wave** effect is a +Trauma:Choice effect.
* The **Basic Storm** effect is +Trauma:Each effect (to **all** Pilots).



# Coach: Running Scenarios

(TBD)


## Structuring Scenes

To use the old adage, a Scene is the "basic building block" of narrative flow in this game. A Scene is a simple term which means "an event, at a place, at a time, where something interesting happens." This of this game like any of the TV shows that inspired it, and imagine how those stories move along from scene to scene, focusing only on the interesting things relevant to the story. Gattaibushido's use of Scenes is exactly like that.

There's no real need to be super formal with the introduction or conclusion of scenes. Just open it up like a TV show would, by telling the players where the action is happening (a game Location), who's there (the Pilots, other background characters, maybe some Threats, etc), and what is immediately happening to focus their attention (sneaking along, going shopping, training montage, etc). Then ask the Pilots to describe what they're doing, and let the rest happen organically from there.

Likely a Conflict will be called for, and it will probably be pretty obvious when it's that time. But basically, the guidelines are:

* If a Pilot has a question about "Hey, can I do this?" or "What happens if I do that?" are you think something interesting might happen, play out a **Gambit** (p. SQUARP)
* If an argument, fight, or other major clash of interests breaks out, use a **Throwdown** (p. SQUARP)
* If a Big Giant Monster attacks, and/or the Pilots go Full Force and fuse together, it's time to **Rumble** (p. SQUARP)

Otherwise, just keep talking with the Pilots. Ask questions, answer questions, build out the world around them, and create a memorable experience. Remember, you started this Scene for a reason, so at some point you need to **Get To The Damn Point** or close it out and move to something more interesting.

You might encounter a handful of effects that have "per scene" limitations. Think of Conflicts as entities contained within Scenes. If an ability says it can only be used "once per scene," and it has already been used once during the scene, starting a conflict within that scene does not reset that counter.


## Final Score - REWRITE 2018

At the end of every completed scenario, calculate a final score for the party, to determine possible additional post-adventure rewards.

I highly recommend *not* telling new Pilots about the scoring system in advance, so that they play their first scenario without the potential pressure of feeling that they need to maximize their score. Let them experience it later, as a lesson of play, so that they may experience their first story "raw" and develop strategies on their own down the road.

**Playtest Note:** This is *definitely* a work in progress. The idea is inspired by a number of genre video games which provide adventure scores based on how well the heroes performed. I wish to use that as a direct component of character evolution.

**Factors which work against the Pilots:**

* Total location damage involved, amplified by number of Razed Locations

**Factors which work in their favor:**

* Total invested Favor cards, amplified by any still remaining unused
* Excess points of Team Resources


### UNSORTED OLD NOTES:

- reward lessons?
- for every X score, they accrue a new evolution, possibly increases to locations, factions, resources, and more.
- accomplishing personal non-battle goals should reward points!



# Coach: Threats - RE-ORG IN PROGRESS 2018

**Threats** are the vast majority of the opposition in the game. Monsters, bullies, mean teachers, natural obstacles, and even Big Giant Space Monsters.

Threats give Coach a number of game options to use against the Pilots.

Threats can actively participate in Throwdowns against the Pilots.

They also work from the background, activating their Waves and Storms as the Crisis events trigger.

Threats are by nature very different than Pilots, and as such use different mechanics. For example, whereas Pilots have many numbers, Threats all have only one: their Threat Rating. This quasi-exponential stat has multiple uses, greatly increasing a Threat's level of danger as the stat goes up.


## Threat Basics


### Anatomy of a Threat

Every Threat has the following core components:

* **Threat Rating:** A numerical rating from 1 to 7.
* **Threat Color:** An associated Color Code based on the Rating
* **Powers:** One or more powers
* **Defeat Conditions:** One or more methods for the Pilots to remove the Threat from play.


#### Threat Rating

Every Threat has a singular number, called its **Threat Rating** (TR). Threat Rating does the following:

* Determines number of bonus cards Coach draws at start of a Throwdown involving this Threat;
* Determines how many Buffer tokens the Threat has to resist damage triggers;
* Determines how many Threat Powers can be attached to it;
* Sets the Threat's hard Strike Range in Throwdowns;
* and Serves as an overall gauge of that enemy's power within the scenario.

With multiple increases in power tied directly to its rank, Threat Rating is thus a quasi-exponential stat. This means that rating 2 threats are *significantly* more powerful than rating 1, and so on.


#### Threat Color

(During play, Coach should try and refer to Threats by their colors over their numbers. This keeps the narrative and themes in play. associated with Rating, inverse of Pilot Harmony: 7 = Red (the worst they can face), 1 = Violet (the easiest to defeat)

Note that the colors here are the reverse of those the Pilots use, and this is intentional. In every one of the game's seven-point color scales, Red is the *worst* for the Pilots, and Violet is the *best*. Thus a Violet Threat is small beans for them, while a Red Threat is earth-shattering doom.


#### Threat Powers

(each is EITHER a blanket modification, OR a special action; see Creating Threats below for more; etc)


#### Defeat Conditions

(blah; different ways to remove them from play; should be some narrative options! see below; etc)



## Threat Design

The Threat design system is intended to be fairly straightforward and modular.

1. Develop a Concept
2. Give it a Threat Rating
3. Give it the required # of Defeat Conditions
4. Give it some Threat Powers


### Step 1: Develop a Concept

(what the hell is this thing anyway? a monster cult, a sinister government organization, a long terrorist, etc?)


### Step 2: Assign a Threat Rating

(When designing a Threat, take into account just how powerful you want this Threat to be; etc)

With the new Threat's concept in place, it's time to give it a Threat Rating. This singular number determines all other aspects of the Threat, including its powers, weaknesses, defeat conditions, and versatility in play.

The higher the rating the more difficult a time the Pilots will have defeating it. Each one-point increase in Threat Rating is a *significant* boost in power.

The table below shows what creation-specific components are determined by the Threat Rating.

* **Color:** The Color of the Threat, which is usually an inverse of the Pilot Harmony colors.
* **TR:** The Color's associated Threat Level. This determines # of Powers, Buffers, and More.
* **Class:** The recommended minimum Class Rank that most of the team should have acquired for this to be considered a "normal" challenge for players.
* **DC:** The minimum number of defeat conditions that must be determined when designing this Threat.
* **Notes:** Descriptive guidelines for Threats of that color

| Threat Color | TR | Class     | DC | Notes                                               |

### Step 3: Set Defeat Conditions

Each Threat *must* have at least one scripted narrative defeat condition. This can be something as simple as "Pull the 'Destroy Bob' level in room 414B of the secret complex" or as complex as solving a complicated puzzle involving a prophecy, a sunken temple, seven British grandmothers, and the letter Q. No matter how complex or simple, however, there must be at least one such condition for defeat. Something like "Shoot it until it dies" is always a useful classic stand-by, but we encourage having some solid unexpected round-about ways for the Pilots to defeat things with a bit of applied creativity and narrative exploration.

At TRs 4 and 7, the minimum number of required defeat conditions increases. See the table above.

You can choose to set a Threat *more* Defeat Conditions than required. Each one you set over the minimum allows you to give it one more Power than its TR would otherwise allow.

Defeat Conditions should be discoverable by the Pilots through a mix of action, investigation, and open play. Intel on these conditions can be made available as they uncover clues about the identity and powers of their enemies.

(**PLAYTEST:** Insert ideas for Defeat Conditions here)

**Condition Examples:**

* Default: Violence
* Simply Survive - Wait it out!
* Bring the secret Macguffin to a remote location
* ...


#### Default: Violence

Threats that have this defeat condition can be taken out by the simple application of +Trauma.


#### Simply Survive

With this condition in place, instead of actively confronting and overcoming the Threat, the Pilots must simply survive until it goes away. This is essentially the "undefeatable" trait, applied to such pervasive dangers as raging storms, planet decay, and even Old Age.


#### Others (TBD)

TBD


### Step 4: Choose Threat Powers

For each point of TR, you can assign the Threat a power. Powers are either:

* **Waves:** Smaller attacks that happen more frequently
* **Storms:** Powerful but rarer attacks
* **Passives:** Special constant rules tweaks

Powers marked **"2X"** have two separate versions, making them effectively two different powers. These are usually damage-based powers that have separate Wave and Storm mechanics These versions must be purchased separately as individual powers with TR allowances. They can be purchased separately as needed - meaning that you do not need to purchase either version in order to acquire the other.

To craft new ones, use these basic guidelines. Waves can do a minor effect, while Storms can do a Major effect. A minor effect can do something small to one player. A major effect can do something heavy to one player, or something small to all players. A minor effect can have a lesser narrative effect. A major effect can have a drastic story-changing narrative effect.

**Threat Powers:**

* Attack (2X) - W: +Trauma:Choice *or* S: +Trauma:Each (immediate)
* Big Giant Monster (BGM) - Designates the Threat as a BGM
* Corrupt (2X) - W: +Disfavor:Choice *or* S: +Disfavor:Each
* Debilitate (2X) - W: One Pilot Discards *or* S: Each Pilot Discards/One Pilot discards entirely
* Demolish (2X) - W: +Ruin:Choice *or* S: +Ruin:Each
* Enforce - Can use Buffers to ignore Strike Range
* Fortify - S: increase TR of existing Threats
* Harbinger - Each Push in a Throwdown forces discards from your Deck
* Heavy-Hitter - Each Push in a Throwdown deals +Trauma
* Infiltrate (2X) - W: Discard 1 current Favor card *or* S: Discard 1 entire Favor card stack
* Rumble Tech - Gives the BGM a new Rumble Tech
* Sap - W: One player discards to burn Team Resouces *or* D: Choose and deplete a Team Resource
* Summon - S: add one new minion Threat with TR = 1/2 (round down)

**UNSORTED IDEAS:**

* restore threat buffers
* draw more cards


#### Attack (2X)

Wave Version: Inflict +Trauma upon a valid target of choice. Storm Version: Inflict +Trauma upon each valid target in play.


#### Big Giant Monster / BGM

This Power designates the Threat as this scenario's Big Giant Monster (or BGM), subject to all the extended rules of the BGMs. BGM Threats can purchase additional Rumble Techs for use during Robo Rumble conflicts (see Robo Rumbles, p. SQUARP).


#### Corrupt (2X)

Wave Version: Inflict +Disfavor upon a revealed Faction of choice. Storm Version: Inflict +Disfavor upon each revealed Faction in play. Factions pushed to three (3) Offenses as a result of either form of this Power convert to Threats.


#### Debilitate (2X)

Wave Version: A Pilot of your choice Discards a card from her Hand. Storm Version: Each Pilot discards a card from their Hand, *or* a single Pilot Discards her entire hHnd. In either version, the Pilot(s) immediately redraws unless in the middle of an active Throwdown, in which case she only redraws after the Throwdown concludes.


#### Demolish (2X)

Wave Version: Inflict +Ruin upon a revealed Location of choice. Storm Version: Inflict +Ruin upon each revealed Location in play.


#### Enforce

PASSIVE: This Threat can spend its Buffers to ignore Strike Ranges in Throwdowns. Each Buffer spent allows the Threat to ignore the Strike Range for a single Push.


#### Fortify

As a Storm, increase TR of any scenario threat by +2, OR Increase TR of any two scenario threats by +1.

When designing a Threat with this Power, you should make sure that every planned Threat in your scenario has a predetermined "upgrade path" in place. This will save time during play, letting you quickly decide what new Threat Powers to add to each such boosted Threat.


#### Harbinger

PASSIVE: This Threat pushes toward Crisis with each action it takes. Whenever it Pushes in a Throwdown, you Discard a number of cards from your Deck equal to one plus the current number of Omens present on the table (all Decks, active or spent).


#### Heavy-Hitter

PASSIVE: Each time this Threat Pushes in a Throwdown, it deals +Trauma.


#### Infiltrate (2X)

Wave Version: Force a single Favor card discard from any one invested Faction in play. Storm Version: Discard the entire Favor stack from any one invested Faction in play.


#### Rumble Tech

Each time this power is taken, the BGM Threat gains a new Rumble Tech of your choice.


#### Sap (2X)

Wave Version: Player of your choice must discard a card of her choice, and then reduce Team Resources by that amount, applied as she sees fit. Storm Version: Choose a Team Resource and deplete it entirely.


#### Summon

As a Storm, summon a new minion/reinforcement Threat into the scenario and active play. The new Threat's TR is equal to 1/2 (round down) that of the summoning Threat. When building a Threat with this power, we recommend predefining the new Threat that will be summoned when this activates.


### ADVANCED: Deeper Threat Customization

(**PLAYTEST:** adding more weaknesses for additional build points; might be too complicated)


## Threats in Play

Threats primarily exist to participate in Throwdowns under your control. The following differences apply to your conflicts:

* **Initial Draw:** Your initial Hand Draw in a new Throwdown is equal to the combined Threat Ratings of all the Threats that are actively participating in the conflict.
* **Buffers:** Each Threat has its own separate Buffers. *Do not* combine them if multiple Threats are participating.
* **Strike Range:** Your Strike Range is equal to the combined Threat Ratings of the participants. Unlike Pilots, Threats simply *can not* play outside of this Range, unless one of the participants has the Enforcer power and spends its own Buffers to activate it.
* **Side Action - Trigger Wave:** As a Side Action, a Threat can discard a Face to activate one of its Waves.
* **Side Action - Trigger Storm:** As a Side Action, a Threat can discard an Ace to activate one of its Storms.


## Big Giant Monsters! (BGM)

Mechanically, a BGM is little more than a Threat with the BGM Power, which gives it a few extra Techs to use specifically in the flow of Robo Rumbles.

Since BGMs are technically base threats, you can include them in the main scenario as opposing forces. This is a common trope in the super sentai style of shows, where the end boss doesn't actually grow to full BGM size until the end of the episode. You can also just leave them unrevealed until they show up to destroy the heroes at the end, if you like, it's your call.

The BGM Threat cannot *initiate* full-size Rumble combat until the proper Crisis point has been reached. However, if you design your scenario to accommodate such, the Pilots might seek out and encounter the BGM much sooner and go into Rumble on their own. In such a case, your BGM is able to return the favor.


### BGM Rumble Techs

You can add special Robo Rumble Techs to any BGM Threat by buying them as additional Threat Powers per the standard Threat creation rules.

**Playtest Notes:** These require a lot of extended testing. This is a completely new take on the prior Rumble mechanic, and as such most of these have not even seen lab testing. They don't have cool monster-y names yet, either. Bear with me, it's a work in progress.

**Action** Techs always require you to spend a Turn using them, and usually require playing or discarding one or more cards from your BGM's Hand.

**Passive** Techs instead provide constant bonuses that do require actions or turns.

**Rumble Techs:**

* **Devastate:** (Action) For every two (2) cards you discard, Pilot Team must discard 1 from their Hands as they see fit. This cannot force a Pilot to Discard their final card.
* **Extend Hand:** (Passive) This Tech increases the BGM max Hand by +1 card. Can be taken multiple times.
* **Power Up:** (Action) Discard X cards, increase your max Hand by +X cards for the *next* Round only.
* **Tech Name:** (Passive/Active) Template...


## Extended Considerations


### Threats and Factions

There may likely be some confusion over the difference between Factions and Threats in play, and this is understandable. They both represent external forces within the scenario, and their mechanical scopes have some definite crossover.

Indeed, some Threats are *also* Factions, even. However, not every Threat can (or should) be a Faction. A Threat that takes the form of a Raging Galactic Void Storm, for example, narratively has no actual will or intent, and thus makes no sense as a Faction.

Think of them as completely different realms of mechanical sway. Factions are mechanics for the Pilot players, while Threats are mechanics for Coach.

While not all Threats are Factions, every Faction *does* have the potential to become a Threat if the Pilots invoke its anger. As such, it helps to consider having a "Threat conversion" worked up in advance on each of your scenario Factions. Given how easy it can be for the Pilots to earn a Faction's disfavor, this is a good practice to make common for all your scenario design process.

When Disfavor ends up turning a Faction against the Pilots, that Faction becomes a Threat. Its prior Agency at the time of conversion becomes its new Threat Rating. Like any other Threat, you can then use that TR to assign it Threat Powers, and then use them against the players.


### Threats and Player Awareness

This should be needless to say, but anyway: the pilots and their players *should not* know anything about the Threats' mechanics prior to a scenario (other than *maybe* the overall scenario X/Y/Z rating, and usually only during cons games and demos). This means they have no way of knowing of enemies are weak, powerful, mortal, or otherwise. They must discover this through play!

**Playtest Note:** Perhaps knowledge of one or more Threat Powers can be narratively imparted through successful Throwdown goals…



# Coach: First Contact

The First Contact scene serves two crucial purposes in play. First, it provides a learn-as-you-go tutorial for the game's core mechanics. A well-run First Contact scene should get the players all used to the flow of the cards, the role of the Decks in play, and the basics of full-team conflict resolution. There are a good number of extended mechanics that don't get play in this scene, but that's okay, as right now it's important to just learn the fundamentals.

Secondly, the scene establishes the groundwork of your new campaign's world-story. At points during the process, the players will directly develop narrative facts about the game world. This results in no two games of ***Gattaibushido:FUSION!*** being identical, creating great variation in player stories and experiences.

Not only that, but the entire core conflict of the scene defines the legacy that the "current age" Pilots (aka the future team that will be created afterward and played onward) inherit. One or more of the future Pilots could even be descended from the people in that encounter, if not having been actually present! How are their founders remembered? Does the Team inherit a legacy of honor, duty, and sacrifice? Or do they instead have to live under the shadow of their predecessors' shame and failures? Are they expected to fill the gigantic shoes of martyr heroes? This scene will decide that, and more.


## Initial Advice


### Three is the Magic Number

For all mechanics in this scene, use a simple base value of 3. Each player has three cards in their base Hand. At the beginning of a Throwdown, each player draws three more into their Hand. All Strike Ranges are 3, and no one gains or uses Charges. If anyone uses the Strike-Assist action in a conflict, the assist bonus is +3. The final Threat is TR 3. If there's a need for a mechanical number, use 3.


### Focus on the Core Stuff

It's important to establish how Gambits and Throwdowns work during this scene. Give each player an opportunity to be involved in a number of things, so that they can directly experience how the real basic mechanics work. The players' characters don't have any powers or Techs to use, so there aren't many options to confuse them or complicate things.

Tell them not to worry about the numbers! Explain them as they come up, but don't over-explain, or give away too much of the strategy just yet. They are *supposed* to make mistakes, and as such they should naturally play without any understanding of what the numbers do. That will lead to unintentionally bad character decisions, which in this case you actually want, as they make the scene more interesting!


### Schism Follows the Team!

Chances are the new players won't know much at all about Harmony and +Schism, and that's great. Just keep count of each time that the players trigger +Schism. Don't apply any trigger effects; simply count how many times it happens, and keep that count handy for team creation time. The actions of this team will color the tone of the team that eventually follows their footsteps in the future! The eventual team of Pilots may start the "game proper" with a lower Harmony as a result. This isn't a punishment! It simply creates a far more interesting first actual play session, while also teaches them a little about the consequences of playing beyond Strike Range.


### Modifying the Scene Components

It's quite possible that the world background your group creates will necessitate changes to the core components of the scene. Sometimes it would make sense for the characters to all be military-only, for example, and other times you might even need to change the actual narrative of the moment to fit a completely different take on the Alien Attack that this document can not foresee. And that is awesome! Just use the same basic approach to create a more appropriate set of internal and external conflicts, and modify the variables as you need to.


## First Contact Flow

First Contact Flow:

1. Quick Explanation
2. Establishment Questions
3. Character Creation
4. Draw Hands and Create the Decks
5. Set the Stage
6. PLAY!
7. ...and bring to a Conclusion


### Quick Explanation

Read Aloud:

> "Before we begin to play the "actual" game, we're going to play out a short Prologue to the greater story that will follow. We're going to do a bit of collective world-building first, to better set the stage for the greater in-game story to take place. This introductory scene takes place in a special off-world colony, where super secret weapons are being developed..."


### Establishment Questions

Now ask the group to start establishing aspects of the setting. Read Aloud:

> But before we set the immediate stage, let's talk about your game world. I want each of you to come up with *at least* one interesting fact about this setting that makes it different from our own world. We already know there are alien invaders, and we know that we will at least eventually have combining giant robots and a battle school.
>
> So now, tell me about the cool timeline for your awesome Giant Robot Space Future. How far in the future are we? What cool new advances in technology have happened? What is new, strange, or different about humanity? And what about the aliens - what makes them so dangerous and unstoppable? Each of you try and come up with at least one Fact about the setting, and you're welcome to add even more than that, too.
>
> Take a moment and think about the timeline, the changes to the world and universe, the distant colony itself, and the alien menace that is about to attack it. When you got something, share it!

Try and get each player to contribute at least one fact. Facts include things such as: Steam-powered starships, alien allies, No More Children, Everyone has Green Skin, Still haven't master Gravity Tech, Planet-Destroying Weapons, and so on. Try and build out cool sci-fi elements of your group's game world, and offer suggestions to make things awesome and unique.

During this flow, you need to try and answer the following questions. Some of them may be answered through the players own volunteered ideas, while others you may end up just having to directly ask for:

* How far in the future is this?
* Where is this colony? What is its name
* What is the nature of the secret weapons being developed at this colony? Who is behind their development?
* What is known about The Enemy?
* What was it about the enemy that made them so unstoppable?


### Create the Characters

Read Aloud:

> As mentioned before, this scene takes place during a war some time ago, on a special off-world colony of Earth. We're going to play out the moment when The Enemy first appeared and made its disastrously violent First Contact.
>
> So now that we've established the facts of the situation, it's time for you all to tell us who you are! The protagonists of this scene are all people who are - for whatever reason - on the site at the time the enemy attacks. Maybe you're military soldiers, assigned to the Colonial Defense Force. Maybe you're actually a worker here, contracted by the administration. Or maybe you're a complete civilian, stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time!
>
> Remember: this is just a flashback - all of this has already happened! These characters are *not* intended to be your heroes for the rest of the game, and will likely not see any play after this Prologue concludes. Instead, the survivors will be legends known by the Mecha pilots for many years to come, as the history of your eventual Battle Team will be rooted in this very moment.
>
> All right, let's jam some character ideas!

Now each player (except you, of course) needs to figure out who their character for this scene is. There are tree important components to this: **Who they are, Why they are here, and What they seek to accomplish.** Start throwing ideas around with the group, and encourage everyone to eventually state all three things for their character. And be sure to write them down for your records!

**First off**, who are you, and what do you do at the base?

**Examples:**

* **Military:** LT, Sarge, Engineer, Front Liner, Sniper, Espionage, Conscript
* **Commercial:** Administrator, Researcher, Scientist, Medtech, Ops Tech, Builder
* **Civilian:** Student, Intern, Military Spouse, Prisoner, Someone's Kid

**Second**, why are you at the base in the first place?

**Examples:**

* I serve in the Colonial Defense Force, protecting the residents.
* I am working on a secret weapon!
* My dad works here and I'm just a kid...

**And finally**, what is your current driving goal? It should be something relatively simple and straightforward, and easy enough to accomplish in this fairly short mini-story.

**Examples:**

* I've got to protect the Governor!
* I've got to find my kid brother!
* I've got to destroy the secret documents!


### Draw Hands & Prepare the Decks

The Decks and Hands in the First Contact scene are prepared differently than the regular game. First, set the Jokers aside - they are not used during this intro scene. Both sides first shuffle their Decks, and each Pilot player three cards to set their initial personal Hands, while you draw none. The Decks are now ready for play.


### Set the Stage

Time to finally set the scene and get the action started. You will need to prepare three new Factions based on the world-building establishment from a few minutes ago. Then narrate the setting of the scene, explaining where they are, how they ended up there, and the immediate problems they must deal with if they want to live. While narrating the intro, it's pretty impactful to throw down those factions onto the table as they come up, adding physical punctuation to your setup speech.

The following canned text is from an example setting of alien hordes attacking a weapon research base on a Jovian moon, about 100 years in the future. It's primarily here as an example of what you'll need to do; use it if you want, but you'll likely need some edits to fit your world-story. The **bold-faced** bits are each special Factions that get put out on the table when they are mentioned; change these to your own.

> By the time the sensors picked up **The Enemy**, it was too late. They swarmed from the dark of space, rushing in like the lightning and leaving a swath of devastation, allowing no survivors and taking no prisoners. None of the base's defenses were prepared to deal with a threat this alien, and this overwhelming!
>
> Somehow, each of you wound up together here, in a cramped tertiary monitoring station in the security wing of the Bunker. Alarms blast throughout the space, forcing you to shout to be heard. Emergency power has so far kept the backup lights on, but it's only a matter of time before those are gone and the darkness takes you all. On the flickering comms screens before you, you watch as more of the space-*things* overrun the few remaining pockets of the **Special Defense Forces** that desperately try to hold them off. An evacuation alert scrolls across each screen, but you all know that chances of escape are slim.
>
> If you work together, you might have a chance of escaping - maybe one of the lifeships will make it through, and warn the people back home? But as you ponder this, you notice one more screen, showing a video feed of a dim, now-abandoned room deeper in the bunker. In that room, beyond that camera, under a single flickering light, is **The Weapon**...
>
> Each of the named cards I just laid down is a "Faction" which you can use for potential added pwoer later in this scene. If you would like, you each have the *option* to invest any *one* of your cards in any of the Factions you choose, and then draw another into your Hand to replace it. *Any* of you can play the cards from the Factions later on, but for now it's up to you if you want to invest.
>
> Now with that set up... what do you do?


### Play! The Three-Part Conflict

And we begin! This now becomes a mix of Open Play and instructional mechanics. This should play out as a highly improvisational three-stage conflict. Your objective as Coach is to first allow them a little bit of role-playing exploration with these (probably) throw-away characters. Then you want to start the action with a few Gambits, establishing new scene components through their resolution. After a bit more exploration, you should lead play towards their first Throwdown, setting the characters' goals in direct conflict with one another. Once that plays through, you lead the scene to an ultimate conclusion with a second and final Throwdown against the enemy!

This creates a three-part structure to the actual play of this scene, based on the nature of the conflict presented:

1. Immediate: Players vs Environment (2-4 Gambits)
2. Internal: Players vs Players (1 PVP Throwdown)
3. Invasion: Players vs Threats (1 PvT Throwdown)


#### 1. Immediate Conflict (PvE)

With the scene set, the players can not explore the scene. Encourage them to enjoy the characters they have created, and more or less "drive 'em like ya stole 'em" as they say. Let them ask questions about the scene, and in turn you should improvise components and details. Mainly just let them run with the scene, and see where they want to take it.

Look for opportunities to steer them toward simple one-off challenges, and use those moments to bring out the Gambit rules (see p. SQUARP). If they want to use the failing equipment, for example, make it a Gambit. Other examples:

* Q: "Do we have any personal weapons?" A: "I dunno, do you?" Play a Gambit!
* Q: "Can we use the terminals to control the security system?" A: "Let's find out!" Play a Gambit!
* Q: "Can we sneak to the Experimental Weapon Bay unnoticed?" A: "I think that's challenging enough to require the cards..." Play a Gambit!

Allow them each one or more turns to see the Gambit rules in play, then look for an opportunity to put them in conflict with each other...


#### 2. Internal Conflict (PvP)

Throughout the scene's flow, you should keep on the lookout for ways to pit the character's built-in goals and mid-scene actions against each other. The scene should build up to a conflict that puts major character objectives at stake. Hopefully this should occur on its own, but you may need to creatively improvise artificial catalysts for direct player-vs-player conflict.

Make sure they all know that if they ever want to "stop talking and just use the cards," they need to throw the proverbial gauntlet. To do this they must take a card from their Hand and slam it face-down on the table, initiating a challenge to their opponent and kicking off a Throwdown.

Once this happens, break out the Throwdown rules (see p. SQUARP). Encourage them to take sides and back each other up. Press the conflict, talk it up, reinforce the near-hopeless desperation of their current situation. Let them *go to town* on each other, too. If they start to "go there" with their narration, just let it ride - and maybe even push it further! Use those emotions to color this scene, as the more intense it gets, the more awesome the rest of the game will be!

The first Throwdown will likely require a frequent amount of rules explanation as you move through it, so re-read the Throwdown mechanics before attempting to guide it. Don't fret the extended details like Techs and Charges and such, just keep it immediate and moving as fast as you can manage. And be sure to remind them that this is where those Faction cards from earlier can be used!

Hopefully, with the Throwdown concluded, they will have a new set of goals in place, and push toward them together. This gives you the chance to lead them toward the final conflict of the scene...


#### 3. Invasion! (PvT)

With all that done, and hopefully with players now more familiar with the mechanics, it's time to look for opportunities to give them a chance to actually fight against an external threat, instead of each other!

Your goal here is to guide things to a place where you can actually bring in the alien menace that has so far only been a background component. You want to set up one last Throwdown, this time pitting their whole team against their first ever Threat.

**The Threat:** TR 3. Powers: Attacker (W); Attacker (S); Heavy-Hitter.

You will again not get to use all the extended Throwdown mechanics due to the simplicity of this tutorial. When resolving the outcome, we recommend saying what *would have* happened, and then simply using the score totals to provide narrative color to the conclusion of the First Contact Scene.

And it's *totally okay* if the players don't win! Let them experience that kind of complete loss, and let it become part of their future team's backstory. Teams with tragic histories create some of the most inspiring and memorable moments of play!

Below is an example of how to set up this final encounter, based on the default canned text for this scene:


##### EXAMPLE: We Got to the Secret Weapon!

The players pushed into the hangar with the Secret Weapon, so now what?

* **First, can they activate it?** If one of them is specifically a test pilot, then just let them. Otherwise turn it into a Gambit for the others.
* **Does it even work?** That's a good question! If it's never been tested before, that could mean another Gambit for actually getting it to do what it's supposed to do in the first place.
* **We got it working!** Let them each invest one more card into the Weapon's Faction, same as before. They will need these cards in the fight to come!
* **How do we get it out of here?** Maybe they have to Gambit to find an exit, or maybe they just blast out. Or maybe instead the enemy takes that moment to blast *in* and confront them right there!

With those issues resolved, it's time to move into action! If they rush out to fight the enemy, they're effectively initiating a Throwdown of their own. Otherwise once out, describe how the Throwdown comes to them, and kick things off same as before.


### Bring it to a Close

You don't want to spend the *entire* game session on this scene, so look for opportunities to bring things to a suitable close. This should be fairly organic and obvious, with the third-stage Throwdown usually being more than enough to provide some kind of resolution. It's okay if there are dangling plot threads, too! Those can provide inspirational fodder for the players to grab onto when developing the after team of Pilots shortly afterward.

Gather up all the playing cards. The players can keep their template sheets if they like, but they may or may not actually become characters. Next: onwards to Character Creation! (see p. SQUARP)
