# *Gattaibushido FUSION!* RPG Rules

As of November 22nd, 2021, the game rules of *Gattaibushido:FUSION!* have entered their semi-final stage. Contained in this repo now are the official rules as close to as they will appear in the published book.

At this point, I need one last crucially important round of external play group feedback before making conclusive revisions, after which I will pass off to my editor and the final stretch toward print will begin.

**What I need from you:** Read the rules, and run the game! The playbooks and printables are not yet in their final format, so you will need to use the custom build process for now. I need as much feedback as you can get to me!

**Specific feedback requested:**

- How killable are Threats? How susceptible to Trauma?
- Final Score calculations needs more testing. Give me your results!

**Remaining to-do:**

- Need to finalize decisions on default playbook Daisho+Robo combos
- Need to finalize playbook chroma palette swap options
- One-Shot rules modifications and advice will be finalized after final round of playtesting input.
- Sample Intro Scenario finalization is pending further play experience feedback from outside groups.
- Grey, Rainbow, and Branwen inclusion, along with Gemstone, Music, and Civil packs, moved to a separate supplement due to space
- Run Find-and-replace on some references, insertion of final Kickstarter references into examples.
- Need to add credits and thanks page
- Send Final draft to my editor/layout/indexer
- Finalization of cover art

**Stride forward, Princess of War. The end is now approaching!**
